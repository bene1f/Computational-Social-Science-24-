# Sentiment Analysis and Topic modelling with YouTubeAPI 

# Computational Social Science Project

## Introduction 
This project uses text mining techniques on comments of TED Talks YouTube videos to investigate sentiment and topics of videos related to minorities. The analysis centres on understanding whether speakers or topics related to minorities influences comment sentiment and identifying the core themes shaping these responses. Specific minority groups examined include individuals with disabilities, black individuals, women, and members of the LGBTQ+ community. The study employs a mixed-methods approach, it exploits the YouTube API to get the data, sentiment analysis and topic modelling. Key findings indicate a predominance of negative comments on videos related to LGBTQ+ and black people, while videos featuring other minority groups tend to receive more positive responses. Subsequent topic modelling reveals the pervasive presence of existing stereotypes within comments directed toward the LGBTQ+ community and black individuals. This research highlights the potential for online platforms to mirror societal sentiment and prejudices towards minorities, emphasising the complex interplay between minority representation, audience sentiment, and the perpetuation of stereotypes.
